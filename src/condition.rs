/*!
Instead of hardcoded states like "pressed" or "released", all actions use an abstract [`ActionState`] component
(which is a required component of [`Action<C>`]). Its meaning depends on the assigned [input conditions](crate::condition),
which determine when the action is triggered. This allows you to define flexible behaviors, such as "hold for 1 second".

Input conditions are components that implement [`InputCondition`] trait. Similar to modifiers, you can attach them to
both actions and bindings. They also evaluated during [`EnhancedInputSet::Update`] right after modifiers in their insertion
order and update [`ActionState`] on the associated action entity.

If no conditions are attached, the action behaves like with [`Down`] condition with a zero actuation threshold,
meaning it will trigger on any non-zero input value.

# Examples

```
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_enhanced_input::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Player;

#[derive(InputAction)]
#[action_output(bool)]
struct Jump;

#[derive(InputAction)]
#[action_output(bool)]
struct Fire;

let mut world = World::new();
world.spawn((
    Player,
    actions!(Player[
        (
            // The action will trigger only if held for 1 second.
            Action::<Jump>::new(),
            Hold::new(1.0),
            bindings![KeyCode::Space, GamepadButton::South],
        ),
        (
            Action::<Fire>::new(),
            Pulse::new(0.5), // The action will trigger every 0.5 seconds while held.
            bindings![
                (GamepadButton::RightTrigger2, Down::new(0.3)), // Additionally the right trigger only counts if its value is greater than 0.3.
                MouseButton::Left,
            ]
        ),
    ])
));
