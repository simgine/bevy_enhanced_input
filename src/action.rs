//! Actions represent high-level user intents, such as "Jump" or "Move Forward".
//!
//! Each action is represented by a new type that implements the [`InputAction`] trait.
//! The trait defines the output type of the action, via the [`InputAction::Output`] associated type.
//! Actions can output different types of values, such as `bool` for button-like actions
//! (e.g., "Jump"), `f32` for single-axis actions (e.g., "Zoom"), or `Vec2`/`Vec3` for multi-axis actions
//! (like "Movement").
//!
//! Actions belong to [contexts](crate::context) that group related actions together,
//! allowing you to enable and disable actions based on the current game state.
//!
//! They are spawned as entities with the [`Action<C>`] component, where `C` is the action type,
//! and related to the context entity via the [`ActionOf<C>`] relationship.
//! The [`actions!`] macro can be used to conveniently spawn multiple actions at once.
//!
//! In turn, actions have input mappings defined by [binding](crate::binding) entities,
//! which are related to the action entity via the [`BindingOf`] relationship.
//!
//! # Responding to actions
//!
//! When an action is evaluated, it produces various [action events](events) that indicate
//! changes in the action's state.
//! See the section on [push-style action handling](../index.html#push-style-responding-to-action-events)
//! in the library documentation for more details.
//!
//! Similarly, you can check the current state and value of an action at any time using the
//! [`Action<C>`], [`ActionState`], [`ActionValue`] and [`ActionTime`] components.
//! See the section on [pull-style action handling](../index.html#pull-style-polling-action-state)
//! in the library documentation for more details.
//!
//! # Configuring actions
//!
//! The behavior of actions can be customized using the [`ActionSettings`] component,
//! which allows you to define accumulation behavior, input consumption, and reset requirements.
//!
//! The behavior of actions can also be modified via
//! [modifiers](crate::modifier) that transform the action value during evaluation,
//! or by using [input conditions](crate::condition) to control when actions are triggered.
//!
//! # Manually firing actions
//!
//! In addition to responding to user input, you can also manually set the state and value of actions
//! using the [`ActionMock`] component or by directly modifying various components before [`EnhancedInputSystems`] are run.
//!
//! This is useful for simulating input during cutscenes,
//! testing, networked replication, AI-controlled players, game replays, or other scenarios where you want to control the action state directly.
