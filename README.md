A powerful observer-based input manager for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org), allowing you to bind keys and other inputs to in-game actions.

The design of this crate was inspired by [Unreal Engine Enhanced Input](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/enhanced-input-in-unreal-engine) plugin.

## Getting Started

Check out the [crate docs](https://docs.rs/bevy_enhanced_input) for an overview of the core concepts
and all of the information needed to quickly integrate this into your game.

The examples in the repo are also a useful to learn from.
[basic_action_management.rs](examples/basic_action_management.rs) should be a good starting point.
